## DataCamp Introduction to Git
- [https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git)
- The first chapter of the DataCamp git course provides an interactive look at all the things that makes Git a great tool to use. And if you want to do more of the DataCamp course, the [Github student pack](https://education.github.com/pack) provides you with 3 months of DataCamp access for free!

## Udacity Version Control with Git
- [https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)
- This Udacity course is very good at touching on git and github and even has good opportunity and instructions on getting some hands on experience! This one is my personal favourite and best part is that it is free!
