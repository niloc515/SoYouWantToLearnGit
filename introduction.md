Introduction to Some Concepts
-----------------------------

### **Git, why should I care?**

Have you ever been writing a paper and ended up with a bunch of documents like *EssayDraft.dox*, *EssaySecondDraft.dox* *EssayFinal.dox*, *EssayFinalForReal.dox*, and as the caffeine wears off and 11:59 approaches *Essayasdklf;ajk;ekjahaskjd.dox*. 

Now your documents folder is a mess and you know that, but you did all this with a reason, each of those documents probably has something unique that you weren't quite willing to get rid of just in case you needed to go back to it. 

Wouldn't it be nicer to have the ability to go back to old versions but still only have one file? Wouldn't it be nice to have a system to write little messages about the changes that you made so you know what the differences between the version are? Thats where Git comes in.

### **Ok, tell me more**

Git is a piece of [version control software](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) originally released in 2005 that allows you to do just that! With Git you can save the changes you make to files and folders in small pieces called **Commits**. You can use these commits to look at the changes made in various versions of code, keep track of how things changed, and attach messages to them so you know at a glance what changes were made in that commit.

Git even allows you to experiment with new versions of your files with out affecting your "good copy" through **Branches**. But I'll let you learn more about that on your own later ðŸ˜‰

### **Cool! so Github is like Git right?**

Github is a website made specifically for storing the packages of commits and branches that Git makes called **Repositories** or **Repos** for short. You can do some git things on github (like making new branches and some basic file editing) but github should be treated more like a file storage server. Working with Git and Github does have some cool advantages, such as [Github pages](https://pages.github.com) and others that I would whole heatedly encourage you to look at once you are more familiar with git. Remember, its entirely separate from git and you can use git just fine on your personal computer without it.

### **Alright! How do I get started?**

Take a look at the README or other files in this repo, they have got some great free resources in them!
